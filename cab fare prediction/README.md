# Linear Regression Model using Keras

This project demonstrates how to build and evaluate a linear regression model using Python and the Keras library. It showcases data loading, preprocessing, model training, and prediction generation using the given dataset.

## Project Overview

The core of the project is implemented in the `linearRegressionModel.ipynb` Jupyter notebook, which contains the following key sections:

### 1. Data Loading and Exploration
- The dataset is loaded and explored to understand its structure and content.
- The first few rows of the dataset are displayed to identify key features and labels.
- Statistical summaries are generated to understand the distribution of the data.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Missing data is handled (if any), and features are cleaned for the modeling process.
- Features are scaled to ensure that the model training is effective.

### 3. Model Building
- The linear regression model is built using the **Keras Sequential API**.
- The model includes input layers and an output layer designed to predict a continuous target variable.

### 4. Model Training
- The model is compiled using the **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** loss function and optimized using **Adam**.
- Training is done using the dataset with specified epochs and batch size.

### 5. Model Evaluation
- The performance of the trained model is evaluated on the test dataset.
- Various metrics like loss values are reported during training.

### 6. Predictions and Visualization
- The trained model is used to predict the target variable on unseen data.
- The predictions are visualized using plots to better understand the model's performance.

### 7. Output
The model outputs are displayed, including:
- Predicted values vs actual values.
- Visualization of error metrics to evaluate how well the model generalizes to new data.
