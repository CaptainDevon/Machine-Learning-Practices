# Machine Learning Workflow

## Overview
Machine Learning Workflow describes how a machine learning model is designed and how it operates with real-life data. The main goal is to create repeatable patterns that systematically transform and process information to generate prediction-based solutions.

## Workflow Phases

### 1) Asking the Right Question
This phase defines the problem statement and the goal to be achieved.

- What are we supposed to do with the data?
- Requirements for the model:
  - Goals we want to achieve
  - Data we need
  - Processes we can perform

### 2) Preparing Data
In this phase, raw data is collected and transformed into the required format through data cleaning.

**Data cleaning includes:**
- Removing unwanted attributes
- Eliminating useless records (records with no details)
- Removing duplicate data

### 3) Finding Requirements for Training the Model
After data preparation, necessary requirements are extracted to train the machine learning model.

### 4) Selecting the Algorithm
This is a crucial phase where the best-suited algorithm is selected based on requirements. 

**Selection Criteria:**
- Type of data (labeled or unlabeled)
- Size of the data
- Dimensionality of the data
- Relationship between data attributes
- Interpretability of the data
- Computational efficiency of the algorithm

### 5) Training the Data
Once the algorithm is selected, the model undergoes training. During this process, the model learns from the given data and stores knowledge for future predictions.

### 6) Testing the Data
After training, the model is tested using a new dataset to evaluate its performance.

**Observations during testing:**
- Accuracy of the modelâ€™s predictions
- Adaptability of the model
- Dynamic behavior of the model

### 7) Refinement of the Model
Also called the **backflow phase**, refinement is necessary when the model exhibits abnormalities or fails to meet the required accuracy levels.

**Refinement processes include:**
- Providing more training data
- Changing the algorithm if needed
- Adjusting model parameters
- A combination of the above methods

## Conclusion
Following this structured workflow ensures that the machine learning model systematically processes data, learns effectively, and makes accurate predictions. Continuous refinement helps maintain model performance over time.
